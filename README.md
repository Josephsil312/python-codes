1)You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. 
Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. 
You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

You have been provided with three lists:

hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered at Carly’s Clippers
prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list
last_week: the number of each hairstyle in hairstyles that was purchased last week(Carly's)

2)Interference in classes

3)i)Write a function called contains that takes two arguments, big_string and little_string and returns True if big_string contains little_string
   ii)Write a function called common_letters that takes two arguments, string_one and string_two and then returns a list with all of the letters they have in common.(appendd)
   
4)Suppose we have two lists of students, students_period_A and students_period_B. We want to combine all students into students_period_B.
Write a for loop that goes through each student in students_period_A and adds it to the end of students_period_B.(appendlst)

5)Suggests you the nearby zoo, museum, Art place,etc.

6)Calculating the age using functions(calculate age)

7)Control flow
The admissions office at Calvin Coolidge’s Cool College has heard about your programming prowess and wants to get a piece of it for themselves. 
They’ve been inundated with applications and need a way to automate the filtering process. They collect three pieces of information for each applicant:

Their high school GPA, on a 0.0 - 4.0 scale.
Their personal statement, which is given a score on a 1 - 100 scale.
The number of extracurricular activities they participate in.(controlflow)

8)This function deletes the the first even elements and prints the odd elements of the list.(deletefirsteven)

9)Calculating the diameter using classes(diameter_using_class)

10)Create a function named divisible_by_ten() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.
Return the count of how many numbers in the list are divisible by 10.(divisileby10)

11)You have a list of dog breeds you can adopt, dog_breeds_available_for_adoption. 
Using a for loop, iterate through the dog_breeds_available_for_adoption list and print out each dog breed.(dogbreed)

12)Create a function named exponents() that takes two lists as parameters named bases and powers. 
Return a new list containing every number in bases raised to every number in powers.(exponents)

13)Write a function called get_boundaries() that takes in two parameters, a number called target and a number called margin.
It should create two variables:

low_limit: target minus the margin
high_limit: margin added to target(get_boundaries)

14)Python gradebook
You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. 
Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.(gradebook)

15)The function should sum the elements of the list until the sum is greater than 9000. When this happens, the function should return the sum. 
If the sum of all of the elements is never greater than 9000, the function should return total sum of all the elements. 
If the list is empty, the function should return 0.(greaterthan9000)

16)This function basically greets the usersentered in the list.(greetings)

17)Create a function named larger_sum() that takes two lists of numbers as parameters named lst1 and lst2.
The function should return the list whose elements sum to the greater number. If the sum of the elements of each list are equal, return lst1(largersumof2lsts)

18)Create Purchasing Information and Receipts for Lovely Loveseats.
In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. 
You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal(lovelyloveset)

19)We have defined a list heights of visitors to a theme park. 
In order to ride the Topsy Turvy Tumbletron roller coaster, you need to be above 161 centimeters. 
Using a list comprehension, create a new list called can_ride_coaster that has every element from heights that is greater than 161.(lstcomphrehension)

20)Create a function named max_num() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.
The function should return the largest number in nums(maxnum)

21)We have provided the list sales_data that shows the numbers of different flavors of ice cream sold at three different locations of the fictional shop, Gilbert and Ilbert’s Scoop Shop. 
We want to sum up the total number of scoops sold.(nestedlst)

22)The function should create a new empty list and add every element from lst that has an odd index. 
The function should then return this new list.(oddindex)

23)You work at Len’s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. 
You are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some of your sales data.
This code deals with slicing.(pizza)

24)You are adding students to a Poetry class, the size of which is capped at 6. 
While the length of the students_in_poetry list is less than 6, use .pop() to take a student off the all_students list and add it to the students_in_poetry list.(poplst)

25)Use the range function in a for loop to print out promise 5 times.(rangef)

26)In script, we have made a function for you called sing_song. Call this function once to see what it prints out.
Now call sing_song a second time.(repeat)

27)This script basically recommends the cheapest mode available in a list of 3 shipping modes.

28))Write a function named same_values() that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.
The function should return a list of the indices where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2(samevalues)

29)Calculates dad's and son's age(sons&dadsage)

30)Strings methods

31)stdents_grades_using_class

32)super keyword in class

33)We have provided a list of temperatures in celsius. 
Using a list comprehension, create a new list called fahrenheit that converts each element in the celsius list to fahrenheit.
*Note: * To convert, use the formula:
temperature_in_fahrenheit = temperature_in_celsius * 9/5 + 32(tempusinglst)

34)Try and except.
