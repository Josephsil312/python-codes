1)You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. 
Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. 
You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

You have been provided with three lists:

hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered at Carly’s Clippers
prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list
last_week: the number of each hairstyle in hairstyles that was purchased last week

2)add_greetings(names)

3)We have provided a list of temperatures in celsius. 
Using a list comprehension, create a new list called fahrenheit that converts each element in the celsius list to fahrenheit.
*Note: * To convert, use the formula:
temperature_in_fahrenheit = temperature_in_celsius * 9/5 + 32

4)We have defined a list heights of visitors to a theme park. 
In order to ride the Topsy Turvy Tumbletron roller coaster, you need to be above 161 centimeters. 
Using a list comprehension, create a new list called can_ride_coaster that has every element from heights that is greater than 161.

5)We have provided the list sales_data that shows the numbers of different flavors of ice cream sold at three different locations of the fictional shop, Gilbert and Ilbert’s Scoop Shop. 
We want to sum up the total number of scoops sold. 

6)You are adding students to a Poetry class, the size of which is capped at 6. 
While the length of the students_in_poetry list is less than 6, use .pop() to take a student off the all_students list and add it to the students_in_poetry list.

7)Your computer is the doorman at a bar in a country where the drinking age is 21.
Loop through the ages list. If an entry is less than 21, skip it and move to the next entry. Otherwise, print the age.

8)You have a list of dog breeds you can adopt, dog_breeds_available_for_adoption. 
Using a for loop, iterate through the dog_breeds_available_for_adoption list and print out each dog breed.

9)Suppose we have two lists of students, students_period_A and students_period_B. We want to combine all students into students_period_B.
Write a for loop that goes through each student in students_period_A and adds it to the end of students_period_B.

10)Use the range function in a for loop to print out promise 5 times.

11)Write a loop that prints each sport in sport_games.

12)Create a function named divisible_by_ten() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.
Return the count of how many numbers in the list are divisible by 10.

13)Create Purchasing Information and Receipts for Lovely Loveseats.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. 
You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal

14)Define a function called repeat_stuff that takes in two inputs, stuff, and num_repeats.
We will want to make this function print a string with stuff repeated num_repeats amount of times. For now, only put an empty print statement inside the function.

15)Calculating the age using function

16)Write a function called get_boundaries() that takes in two parameters, a number called target and a number called margin.

It should create two variables:

low_limit: target minus the margin
high_limit: margin added to target

17)Calculates dad's and son's age

18)Creating the spreadsheet for n number rows

19)Write a function called loading_screen that prints "This page is loading..." to the console

20)In script, we have made a function for you called sing_song. Call this function once to see what it prints out.
Now call sing_song a second time.

21)Control flow
The admissions office at Calvin Coolidge’s Cool College has heard about your programming prowess and wants to get a piece of it for themselves. 
They’ve been inundated with applications and need a way to automate the filtering process. They collect three pieces of information for each applicant:

Their high school GPA, on a 0.0 - 4.0 scale.
Their personal statement, which is given a score on a 1 - 100 scale.
The number of extracurricular activities they participate in.

22)Try and except

23)Python gradebook
You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. 
Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.

24)You work at Len’s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. 
You are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some of your sales data.

25)The function should remove elements from the front of lst until the front of the list is not even. 
The function should then return lst.

26)The function should create a new empty list and add every element from lst that has an odd index. 
The function should then return this new list.

27)Create a function named exponents() that takes two lists as parameters named bases and powers. 
Return a new list containing every number in bases raised to every number in powers.

28)Create a function named larger_sum() that takes two lists of numbers as parameters named lst1 and lst2.
The function should return the list whose elements sum to the greater number. If the sum of the elements of each list are equal, return lst1

29)The function should sum the elements of the list until the sum is greater than 9000. When this happens, the function should return the sum. 
If the sum of all of the elements is never greater than 9000, the function should return total sum of all the elements. 
If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

30)Create a function named max_num() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.

The function should return the largest number in nums

31))Write a function named same_values() that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.

The function should return a list of the indices where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2.

32)i)Write a function called contains that takes two arguments, big_string and little_string and returns True if big_string contains little_string
   ii)Write a function called common_letters that takes two arguments, string_one and string_two and then returns a list with all of the letters they have in common.
   
33)All of the string methods
